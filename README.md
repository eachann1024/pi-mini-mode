A compact, configurable footer for [Pi](https://pi.dev). Your model, usage, cost estimate, context, and generation speed — at a glance.

## Minimal output

`/pi-mini-mode-settings` now has **Lens**, a separate **Collapse replies** switch, and **Minimal output**. Collapsed replies are off by default, so Pi's conversation history stays native until you turn them on. While the switch is off, Minimal output options stay disabled.

- `/mini-lens-minimal on` shows the user's Markdown on an accent-tinted surface, a background-free process summary, and the final reply without a heading or extra background. No duplicate dock panel.
- Each turn uses one shared tree showing the latest **ten summary entries**: available thinking, tool calls, streaming tool output, and skill reads. `Ctrl+O` expands the full Markdown process and toggles it closed again; new questions start collapsed; tools without output show an elapsed wait counter, and empty progress events never overwrite existing content; there are no section headings, collapsed counts, or completion labels. Original session messages remain intact.
- Agent/subagent calls share the same chronological tree as tools and skills; `Ctrl+O` reveals tasks and Markdown output. A returned call does not imply background completion.
- The pi-subagents `async subagent` / `Async agents` widget uses a background-free status tree, retaining native detail shortcuts and output paths. This adapter is active only in minimal mode, restores on disable, and passes unknown formats through. Grouping design reference: [pi-cc-extensions](https://github.com/minuque/pi-cc-extensions).
- `/mini-lens-history` browses complete process entries, five at a time.
- Final Markdown streams as text events arrive; failures and interruptions are indicated.
- `/reload` remounts the transcript, including history created in native mode. Expanded tree rails continue through paragraphs, blank lines and code blocks.
- `/mini-lens-minimal off` restores Pi's default conversation history.

The user surface blends the active Pi accent with its user background. Process and answer text have no background. User padding is two terminal columns horizontally and one row vertically. Markdown, highlighted code, tables and Mermaid terminal diagrams work in light/dark themes; incomplete, unsupported or over-wide diagrams retain their source. **Minimal mode uses a private Pi 0.85.x layout adapter**, without patching the Pi installation. Unknown layouts refuse activation and retain native output. Recheck compatibility after Pi upgrades; another extension replacing the transcript may conflict.

Checks: `npm run check && npm test`. Real terminal smoke test: `python3 test/minimal-pty.py` (Python 3, Node, and the installed dependency's bundled Pi CLI). It uses temporary fixtures, tests regular/fullscreen, toggling, ten-entry process and Ctrl+O expand/collapse, restored results, and narrow terminals, without model calls.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@each1024/pi-mini-mode
```

Run `/reload` in Pi. Requires **Pi ≥ 0.84.0**.

Customize with `/pi-mini-mode-settings`. Changes take effect immediately.

**Fits your terminal.** Follows your Pi theme and adapts to narrow widths. Only the footer changes; Pi's built-in tool and thinking views stay intact.

Bundled themes `cc-light` / `cc-dark` are vendored from [pi-cc-extensions](https://github.com/minuque/pi-cc-extensions) (MIT).


## Reference

<details>
<summary><strong>First run & configuration</strong> — defaults, controls, and settings file</summary>

On the first interactive TUI session, Mini Lens shows a preview with every field enabled by default:

```text
deepseek-v4-flash  high  Total 45K  Cached 25K  CH 40.0%  $0.012  500/1.0M  █░░░░░░░░░  1%  120 tok/s
```

The first-run picker offers **Keep defaults** and **Configure now**. Keeping defaults persists footer fields as enabled, leaves collapsed replies off, and prevents the prompt from appearing again; configuring opens the same settings list immediately. Print, JSON, and other non-interactive modes never prompt.

Open that settings UI any time with:

```text
/pi-mini-mode-settings
```

The focused option and its corresponding preview field use bold theme `accent` text with a `selectedBg` background. Fullscreen Pi supports hover to focus and click to toggle; regular terminal mode uses keyboard navigation. Hovering never changes a setting.

Changes take effect immediately. The command requires Pi's TUI mode. Its preview always uses fixed example data rather than your current session, while reflecting every setting toggle immediately.

Settings are stored globally at Pi's agent directory (normally `~/.pi/agent/mini-lens.json`; installations with a different Pi config directory use that directory). A malformed or missing file safely falls back to the defaults.

- **Generation speed**
  - **Show tok/s unit** (`mini-lens-speed-unit-show`) is the indented sub-setting shown beneath **Show latest generation speed** in `/mini-lens-settings`. Turning it off keeps the speed number (for example `40.0`) and removes only `tok/s`.
  - The sub-setting is retained when generation speed itself is hidden.

<summary><strong>How metrics work</strong> — tokens, cache, speed, and estimated price</summary>

Session totals are aggregated from each finalized `assistant` and `toolResult` entry on the active session branch. This includes nested LLM work reported by tools (such as a child agent) exactly once. `Total` uses the provider's `totalTokens` when supplied; older/custom results without it fall back to the sum of input, output, cache-read, and cache-write tokens. `Cached` is cache-read + cache-write (included in Total); `CH` is cache-read / (input + cache-read). Only persisted finalized usage is counted, so stream updates cannot double count totals.

During an assistant stream, speed appears as soon as a positive cumulative `usage.output` sample and elapsed time are available. It is refreshed while streaming and is output tokens divided by elapsed time from the assistant message start. The completed rate remains visible while later assistant messages only call tools or wait for output; it is replaced only by a newer measurable generation. Regressing output samples and non-increasing timestamps are ignored. For a tool result that reports nested LLM usage but has no stream events, the final rate is output tokens divided by that tool execution's duration. A tool that does not report output usage has no measurable speed and leaves the prior rate intact.

Before a measurable response exists, the speed field is absent entirely—Mini Lens never displays a `-- tok/s` placeholder. When present, speed is the rightmost footer field (the context percentage, if enabled, is immediately to its left). Its color uses Pi theme semantics: **success** at >=30 tok/s, **warning** at 10–29.9 tok/s, and **error** below 10 tok/s. No colors are hard-coded, so it follows the selected Pi theme.

The price is the same finalized active-branch usage and configured per-million-token rates. It is an estimate, not a provider invoice. In narrow terminals, the footer drops/truncates lower-priority content to remain one line without overflow.

<details>
<summary><strong>Development</strong> — local setup and checks</summary>

Install only the local copy while developing; installing npm and local copies together double-registers the extension:

```bash
pi remove npm:@each1024/pi-mini-mode && pi install /path/to/pi-rolling-process
npm run check
npm test
```

After source changes, run `/reload` in an already-open Pi session. `npm run check` runs TypeScript checking and `npm test` runs the footer, settings, and publishing self-checks.

</details>

## Publishing

Pushes to `main` automatically publish to npm after `npm ci`, `npm run check`, and `npm test`; the workflow also supports manual dispatch on `main`. Each release uses the higher of the local version baseline and npm's latest stable version plus one patch. Versions change only in the runner, with no version commits or tags; raise the baseline in `package.json` and the lockfile for a major/minor release. Already-published commits are skipped. Actions concurrency can replace pending pushes, so not every push (or every commit within a push) is guaranteed a separate package release.

One-time setup: publish the initial `@each1024/pi-mini-mode@1.3.1` package using an authenticated maintainer account, then configure its npm **Trusted Publisher** for GitHub owner `eachann1024`, repository `pi-mini-mode`, workflow `publish.yml` (no environment), allowing direct `npm publish`. Subsequent releases use OIDC and provenance, without an npm token.
